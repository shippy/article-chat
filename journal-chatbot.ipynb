The remainder of the paper will be structured as follows: In the section “Mechanisms of Algorithmic Bias in Medical Practice,” we give an outline of the different mechanisms of algorithmic bias in medical practice, whereby we distinguish between formal, substantive, and normative notions of algorithmic bias. Thereafter, the section “From Algorithmic Bias to Fairness” will discuss to what extent different standards of fairness help to counteract the threat of algorithmic discrimination. Here, we argue that fairness cannot be restored merely by mitigating the differences in the algorithm’s predictive accuracy for different demographics. Instead, a wider array of normative criteria needs to be taken into account. By discussing the constraints of formal accounts of algorithmic fairness, we hope to\n",

      "- There are two lessons to be drawn from the study. The first one is simple: developers should be wary of the larger social context when choosing the target category for an algorithm. By contrast, the second one is that there may be profound problems in the way that machine-learning algorithms operate, namely by making predictions in virtue of exploiting correlations in the data while being unable to capture potentially discriminatory factors. We will address this issue in the subsequent chapter. In sum, the substantive notion helps us to understand the various pragmatic and normative constraints which give rise to algorithmic bias. It does not, however, grasp the whole morally normative dialectic of algorithmic bias..\n",
